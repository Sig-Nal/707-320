MODEL:

Based on the model of Innis Cunningham, also used some developements from Isaias Prestes. Further changes by Andino Gonth채ler.

Andino Gonth채ler introduced autopilot, pushback, new reversers, new gear (with rolling wheels and moving nosegear), several lights (landing lights, logo lights, nav lights, cabin lights, strobes, beacon, with interruptors on the overhead panel), tiller steering, several instruments for the flightdeck (ASI, HSI, VSI, fuel, autopilot, warning system, altimeter, clock, flaps, gear, egt, rpm, VOR/ADF, VOR/DME, etc.), livery selection for both Passenger and for Cargo versions, pedestal (with throttles, flap, airbrake, elevator trim, etc.), yokes with charts, some sounds, ground services (stairs, fuel truck, de-ice truck, power unit, catering truck, bagagge, all taken from the A330), etc.

Of course, many of these new devices come from other free FlightGear planes, and were adapted to the Boeing 707. I specially used some instruments and parts from the Boeing 777, the Boeing 747, the Boeing 737, the Il-96, the DC-10-30, the Airbus 330 (omega hangar) and other FG planes.
